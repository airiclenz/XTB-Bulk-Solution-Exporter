Export smarter, **not harder**. <br><br>
Bulk Solution Exporter automates the export *and* import of multiple Power Platform / Dataverse / Dynamics 365 solutions in one click - complete with version bumping, Git commits, and clean output folders. Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, configuration backups, or any team that juggles more than a handful of solutions.
