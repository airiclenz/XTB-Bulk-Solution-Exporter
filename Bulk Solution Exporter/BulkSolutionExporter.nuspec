		<description>Export smarter, not harder.
The Bulk Solution Exporter is a powerful XrmToolBox plugin designed to streamline and automate the export and import of multiple Dataverse / Dynamics 365 solutions.
Whether youâ€™re managing development pipelines, prepping deployment packages, or backing up environments, this tool saves hours of repetitive manual work.

ðŸš€ Key Features and Benefits
			
â€¢	Batch Export and Import - Export or import multiple solutions in one operationâ€”managed or unmanagedâ€”with full control over export settings like including source components or auto-publishing.
â€¢	Automated Version Management - Apply consistent versioning to your solutions automatically. Support for custom version patterns, auto-increment, and per-solution overrides makes it easy to enforce release standards.
â€¢	Organized Output and Custom Paths - Define export paths per solution or per environment to keep your output clean, structured, and easy to track.
â€¢	Integrated Git Commit Support - Seamlessly commit exported solutions to your Git repositoryâ€”ideal for DevOps, backup strategies, and release governance.
â€¢	Command History and Repeatability - Review and repeat previous exports using the built-in export history for consistent, traceable deployments.
â€¢	Designed for Teams - Whether youâ€™re a solo developer or part of a large delivery team, the tool helps standardize solution management across environments and projects.

ðŸ§  Why Use It?
			
Manual exports are tedious and error-prone. This plugin provides a fast, repeatable, and version-controlled way to manage solution artifactsâ€”making it the perfect companion for ALM, CI/CD pipelines, and source-controlled development processes.
